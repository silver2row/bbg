Hello...

This is a Motor Bridge Cape addition for the BeagleBone Green

...

w/ including software

----------------XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-----------------

The software for MotorBridge.py was typed up by a different person. That info. is listed in 

...

that specific file. I did have help from this page online to start the software example(s).

https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/MotorBridgeCapeforBBG_BBB/blob/master/tests/DCMotorTest.py

...

So...if you are using your MotorBridge.py library w/ the Motor Bridge Cape, use uMove.py to
run your favorite bunch of motors. I personally have two geared motors for the software 
example listed here as "uMove.py" under MBC. MBC, as you guessed it, stands for Motor Bridge
Cape.

And...

You will have to go to https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python and use the
Adafruit_BBIO library to make things "officially" work.

If you are up-to-date w/ your version of Adafruit_BBIO, you may need to downgrade to version
1.0.3 by using this bunch of commands:

sudo pip uninstall Adafruit_BBIO

and ultimately this command:

sudo pip install Adafruit_BBIO==1.0.3

...

Linux beaglebone 4.9.82-ti-r102 is listed when I perform the cmd: uname -a.

BeagleBoard.org Debian Image 2018-03-05 is listed when I peform this cmd: cat /etc/dogtag

If you need assistance w/ set up or breakdown of the BBG for your Motor Bridge Cape, either
look to me or use this site: https://forum.seeedstudio.com/viewforum.php?f=38&sid=0e0aecd64d2004f50736a8f20ba0a06c.

There has been some updates recently, in the last two or three days, w/ the Motor Bridge Cape library b/c of 
Adafruit_BBIO changes. You can look online for the respected changes at this specific address:
https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python.
