    Hello...

# This is a Motor Bridge Cape addition for the BeagleBone Green Wireless w/ included software

    ----------------XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-----------------

The software for MotorBridge.py was typed up by a different person. That info. is listed in
that specific file. I did have help from this page online to start the software example(s).

So...if you are using your MotorBridge.py library w/ the Motor Bridge Cape, use uMove.py to
run your favorite bunch of motors. I personally have two geared motors for the software 
example listed here as "uMove.py" under MBC. MBC, as you guessed it, stands for Motor Bridge
Cape.

Oh and you now need to install this:

    pip3 install smbus2

@ Change your ideas accordingly. You can see the changes in the source of the MotorBridge.py file.

...

Linux beaglebone 4.14.108-ti-r116 is listed when I perform the cmd: uname -r.

BeagleBoard.org Debian Image 2019-09-08 is listed when I peform this cmd: cat /etc/dogtag

If you need assistance w/ set up or breakdown of the BBG for your Motor Bridge Cape, either
look to me or find another route. Godspeed!
